# Room Code Generation Fix

## Issue
Game IDs in multiplayer mode were showing as numbers (1, 2, 3) instead of alphanumeric codes.

## Root Cause
The backend on Render was using the old code that generates numeric IDs for all games.

## Solution Implemented
1. **Backend Changes (server.js)**:
   - Added `generateRoomCode()` function that creates 6-character alphanumeric codes
   - Modified `createGame()` to use alphanumeric codes for multiplayer mode
   - Added collision detection with fallback mechanism

2. **Frontend Changes (Menu.jsx)**:
   - Removed duplicate room code generation
   - Updated UI to show proper feedback when no room code exists
   - Added disabled state for copy button

## Expected Behavior
- **Multiplayer mode**: Generates codes like `TNY4E6`, `GEQ2JO`, `M9DR1Y`
- **Single player mode**: Still uses numeric IDs like `1`, `2`, `3` (for simplicity)

## Test Results
Local testing confirms the logic works correctly:
- Multiplayer: `2OM7U0`, `6U7RLB`, `3J0RIL`, `12G5U6`, `EPJI4Z`
- Single player: `1`, `2`, `3`

## Deployment Status
- ✅ Frontend: Deployed to Firebase
- ✅ Backend code: Committed and pushed to GitHub
- ⏳ Backend deployment: Waiting for Render to redeploy

## Next Steps
1. Verify Render has redeployed the backend with new changes
2. Test multiplayer room creation to confirm alphanumeric codes
3. If still showing numbers, manually trigger Render redeploy

## Code Changes Summary
```javascript
// Before: All games used numeric IDs
const gameId = id || gameIdCounter++;

// After: Multiplayer uses alphanumeric, single player uses numeric
const gameId = id || (mode === 'multi' ? generateRoomCode() : gameIdCounter++);
```
