# 🎮 Game Statistics Integrity Update

## 🔒 **Important Change: Multiplayer-Only Stats Tracking**

### 🚨 **Problem Identified:**
- Single-player (local) games were being counted in competitive statistics
- Players could artificially inflate their scores by playing against themselves
- This compromised the integrity of leaderboards and achievements

### ✅ **Solution Implemented:**

#### 1. **Stats Tracking Restriction**
- **Only multiplayer games** now count towards statistics
- Single-player games are completely excluded from:
  - Games played counter
  - Games won counter
  - Total score calculation
  - Win streaks
  - Achievement progress
  - Game history records
  - Leaderboard rankings

#### 2. **Code Changes Made:**

**GameBoard.jsx:**
```javascript
// Only track stats for multiplayer games
if (winner && gameStartTime && mode === 'multi') {
  updateGameStats(gameData);
} else if (winner && mode === 'single') {
  console.log('Single-player game completed - stats not tracked');
}
```

**userStats.js:**
```javascript
// Only track multiplayer games for competitive integrity
if (gameData.gameMode !== 'multi') {
  console.log('Single-player game not tracked (prevents score manipulation)');
  return;
}
```

#### 3. **UI Updates:**
- Added clear messaging in profile dashboard
- Statistics section now shows "multiplayer gaming journey"
- Note: "Only multiplayer games count towards statistics for competitive integrity"
- Recent games section clarified as "multiplayer matches"

### 🎯 **What This Means:**

#### ✅ **Counted (Multiplayer Games):**
- Real-time multiplayer matches
- Room-based games with other players
- Games played through socket.io connections
- Competitive matches where skill matters

#### ❌ **Not Counted (Single-Player Games):**
- Games against AI
- Local practice games
- Solo gameplay
- Games in 'single' mode

### 🏆 **Competitive Integrity Benefits:**

1. **Fair Leaderboards** - Only genuine competitive performance counts
2. **Meaningful Achievements** - Achievements reflect real multiplayer skill
3. **Accurate Win Rates** - Win percentages represent competitive success
4. **Honest Rankings** - Global ranks based on actual player vs player performance
5. **Skill-Based Progression** - Stats reflect improvement against real opponents

### 📊 **Score System Still Applies:**
The advanced scoring system (base score + grid bonus + streak bonus) still works the same way, but **only for multiplayer games**:

```
Multiplayer Win on 5x5 Grid (3rd streak) = 100 + 50 + 30 = 180 points ✅
Single-player Win on 5x5 Grid = 0 points (not tracked) ❌
```

### 🎮 **Player Experience:**
- **Single-player games** remain fully functional for practice and fun
- **Multiplayer games** are where competitive progression happens
- Clear messaging helps players understand the system
- No confusion about which games count

### 🔄 **Migration Notes:**
- Existing stats remain unchanged (historical data preserved)
- New games follow the multiplayer-only rule
- Players can still enjoy single-player mode without affecting stats
- Achievements and streaks continue from current state

This change ensures the Chain Reaction competitive ecosystem remains fair and meaningful for all players! 🏆
